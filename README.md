This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to evaluate the performance of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The evaluation is conducted by comparing the model's responses to a set of predefined questions against ground truth answers. The questions are specifically related to the Llama model, a series of language models developed by Meta AI.

# Embeddings Model
Embeddings are a crucial component in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including RAG models. They convert text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. The choice of embedding model significantly affects the performance of RAG because it influences how well the model can understand and retrieve relevant information.

# Why Choice of Embedding Model Affects RAG Performance
The quality and characteristics of embeddings determine how effectively the RAG model can match queries with relevant documents. High-quality embeddings capture nuanced semantic relationships, leading to better retrieval and generation performance. Conversely, poor-quality embeddings can result in irrelevant or inaccurate responses.

# Evaluating RAG with RAGAS
RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment) is a tool designed to evaluate RAG applications. It provides metrics and methodologies to assess the performance of RAG models by comparing their responses to ground truth answers. This notebook leverages RAGAS to systematically evaluate the RAG model's performance, offering insights into its strengths and areas for improvement.
